The aim is to produce a modern typeface, reminiscent of Irish calligraphy. It is intended to be suitable for a wide range of uses, mainly road signs, but also for body text on government websites or official documents requiring the use of Irish Gaelic for instance. Its primary use for road signage produced letterforms designed to work with existing signs, that are using the british Transport font. Legibility constraints have also been taken into account.
