# Liffey

The name *Liffey* comes from the eponymous river, that ultimately flows to Dublin Bay. The irish name is ‹&thinsp;An Life&thinsp;›, and historically ‹&thinsp;An Ruirtheach&thinsp;›. It is a sans-serif typeface, inspired by the insular irish calligraphic letterforms, to convey an united cultural identity.

The aim is to produce a modern typeface, reminiscent of Irish calligraphy. It is intended to be suitable for a wide range of uses, mainly road signs, but also for body text on government websites or official documents requiring the use of Irish Gaelic for instance. Its primary use for road signage produced letterforms designed to work with existing signs, that are using the british Transport font. Legibility constraints have also been taken into account.

> [!NOTE]
> Most of the work has been dedicated to *Liffey Heavy*, which explains its slightly more accurate drawing and realistic usability. *Liffey Regular* is still usable as body text &ndash; as the spacing work has been done &ndash; but kerning would preferably be let to the InDesign's automatic *optical kerning* engine.
